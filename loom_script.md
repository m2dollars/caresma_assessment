# Dementia Detection AI - Loom Walkthrough Script

## üéØ **Introduction (30 seconds)**

"Hi! I'm excited to present the Dementia Detection AI system I've built for Caresma. This is a comprehensive conversational AI solution designed to assess cognitive health in elderly users through natural voice interactions. Let me walk you through my thought process, the working prototype, and key insights from this implementation."

## üß† **Part 1: Problem Understanding & Holistic Thinking (1 minute)**

### **The Challenge**
"First, let me explain how I approached this problem holistically. We're dealing with a sensitive healthcare application that needs to:

- **Be accessible to elderly users** - voice-first design, large fonts, simple interface
- **Maintain privacy and security** - HIPAA compliance, data encryption
- **Scale efficiently** - handle multiple concurrent users
- **Provide accurate assessments** - evidence-based cognitive evaluation
- **Integrate with healthcare workflows** - calendar scheduling, provider notifications

### **System Architecture Overview**
*[Show the visual architecture diagram]*

"I designed this as a modular microservices architecture with:
- **React frontend** for the voice interface
- **FastAPI backend** for high-performance AI processing  
- **Redis job queue** for handling multiple LLM calls efficiently
- **WebSocket connections** for real-time audio streaming
- **Multiple AI services** integrated through a robust pipeline"

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Part 2: Technical Architecture Deep Dive (2 minutes)**

### **Voice-First Design Philosophy**
*[Navigate to the voice interface]*

"The core principle is voice-first interaction. Elderly users can simply speak naturally, and the system handles everything:
- **Real-time speech-to-text** using Deepgram
- **Natural conversation flow** with GPT-4
- **Empathetic AI responses** that are age-appropriate
- **Text-to-speech synthesis** using ElevenLabs for natural voice"

### **Redis Job Queue Architecture**
*[Show the backend code structure]*

"Here's where I implemented practical creativity under constraints. Instead of blocking API calls, I used Redis with Celery to:
- **Queue multiple LLM requests** asynchronously
- **Handle rate limiting** across different AI providers
- **Implement priority queuing** for critical assessments
- **Provide automatic retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Scale horizontally** based on demand"

### **AI Processing Pipeline**
*[Show the task files]*

"The AI pipeline processes conversations through multiple stages:
1. **Audio capture** ‚Üí WebSocket streaming
2. **Speech-to-text** ‚Üí Deepgram processing
3. **Cognitive analysis** ‚Üí GPT-4 assessment
4. **Response generation** ‚Üí Natural conversation
5. **Text-to-speech** ‚Üí ElevenLabs synthesis
6. **Report generation** ‚Üí Structured assessment"

- **Accessibility features** with large fonts and high contrast
- **Error handling** with clear user feedback"

### **Report Generator Demo**
*[Navigate to report generator]*

"The report generator demonstrates the assessment capabilities:
- **Upload transcript files** or paste conversation text
- **AI-powered analysis** across 5 cognitive domains
- **Visual score display** with color-coded risk levels
- **Detailed recommendations** for care planning
- **Professional report format** suitable for healthcare providers"

### **React Frontend Components**
*[Show client/src structure]*

"The frontend uses modern React patterns:
- **Material-UI components** for consistent design
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **WebSocket integration** for real-time communication
- **Responsive design** for different screen sizes
- **State management** for conversation flow"

### **Redis Job Queue Implementation**
*[Show the Celery tasks]*

"Here's the practical execution - the Redis job queue handles:
- **Speech-to-text processing** with Deepgram
- **AI conversation management** with GPT-4
- **Text-to-speech generation** with ElevenLabs
- **Assessment analysis** and scoring
- **Error recovery** and task monitoring"

## üß™ **Part 5: Working Prototype Demonstration (2 minutes)**

### **Live Voice Interaction**
*[Actually demonstrate speaking to the system]*

"Let me show you the system working live:
1. **Start a conversation** - the AI greets naturally
2. **Speak into microphone** - real-time audio capture
3. **AI processes and responds** - you can see the job queue working
4. **Natural conversation flow** - feels like talking to a human
5. **Assessment happening in background** - cognitive analysis running"

### **Report Generation**
*[Upload a sample transcript and generate report]*

"Now let's see the assessment capabilities:
1. **Upload sample transcript** - realistic conversation data
2. **AI analyzes the conversation** - processing through Redis queue
3. **Generate structured report** - scores across cognitive domains
4. **Display risk assessment** - Low/Medium/High classification
5. **Provide recommendations** - actionable care suggestions"
