### **Technical Highlights (2 minutes)**

#### **Redis Job Queue Implementation**
*[Show server/tasks/audio_processing.py]*
```python
@celery_app.task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
def process_audio(self, session_id: str, audio_data: bytes):
    # Speech-to-Text with Deepgram
    # Queue for AI processing
    # Handle errors with retry logic
```

#### **WebSocket Real-time Communication**
*[Show server/services/websocket_manager.py]*
```python
async def send_audio_response(self, audio_data: bytes, session_id: str):
    # Real-time audio streaming
    # Connection management
    # Error handling
```

#### **AI Integration Pipeline**
*[Show the task flow]*
- Deepgram â†’ Speech-to-Text
- OpenAI GPT-4 â†’ Cognitive Analysis  
- ElevenLabs â†’ Text-to-Speech
- Redis â†’ Job Queue Management

### **Key Differentiators (1 minute)**

#### **What Makes This Special:**
1. **Voice-First Design** - Built specifically for elderly users
2. **Redis Job Queue** - Handles multiple LLM calls efficiently
3. **Real-time Processing** - WebSocket streaming for smooth UX
4. **Healthcare Compliance** - HIPAA-ready architecture
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Microservices with auto-scaling

#### **Practical Creativity:**
- **Multi-AI Integration** - Not locked into single provider
- **Async Processing** - No blocking on API calls
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of failures
- **User Experience** - Clear feedback and status indicators

### **Reflection & Improvements (1 minute)**

#### **What Worked:**
- Redis job queue eliminated API blocking
- Voice interface feels natural for elderly users
- Report generation provides actionable insights
- Modular architecture enables easy extension

#### **What I'd Improve:**
- Fine-tune AI models on elderly conversation data
- Add multi-language support
- Integrate with EHR systems
- Implement family notification system
- Add mobile app version
